Notebooks
=========

You can find here detailed examples for different part of plaid-bridges, nicely explained in jupyter notebooks.

.. note::
   The `Muscat <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/muscat>`_ dependency is required on some of the notebooks,
   and is not distributed with the `plaid <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/plaid>`_
   conda-forge package.
